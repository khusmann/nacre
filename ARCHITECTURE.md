## Two-Phase Rendering

nacre splits rendering into two phases: **process** and **mount**.

### Phase 1: `process_tags`

Walks the tag tree recursively and produces:

- **`tag`** — A clean HTML tag tree with all functions removed. Reactive
  attributes are replaced by stable auto-generated element IDs. Control-flow
  nodes become `<div style="display:contents">` placeholders.
- **`bindings`** — List of `{id, attr, fn}` for each reactive attribute.
- **`events`** — List of `{id, event, handler, mode, ms, leading, coalesce}` for
  each event callback.
- **`control_flows`** — List of `{type, id, ...}` for each `When`, `Each`,
  `Index`, or `Match` node.
- **`shiny_outputs`** — List of `{id, render_call}` for each `Output` node.

The tag tree is now plain HTML that can be sent to the client. All reactive
wiring is deferred to mount.

### Phase 2: `nacre_mount_processed`

Takes the output of `process_tags` and a Shiny `session`, then wires up:

1. **Reactive bindings** — Each binding gets an `observe()` that sends
   `nacre-attr` messages when the reactive value changes.
2. **Event handlers** — Each event gets an `observeEvent()` on a namespaced
   input ID (`nacre_ev_{id}_{event}`). The handler is dispatched based on its
   formal argument count (0, 1, or 2 args). Event registration is sent to the
   client as a `nacre-events` message.
3. **Shiny outputs** — Each output's render call is assigned to
   `session$output[[id]]`.
4. **Control-flow nodes** — Each node gets an `observe()` that manages its
   lifecycle (see below).

Returns a mount handle with `$tag` (the processed HTML) and `$destroy()` (tears
down all observers).

## Control Flow Lifecycle

Each control-flow type manages a `current_mount` — a mount handle from a
recursive `nacre_mount_processed` call.

**When** — Observes the condition. On change: destroys the current mount,
processes the active branch, sends a `nacre-swap` message, mounts the new
branch.

**Match** — Same pattern, but iterates cases to find the first truthy condition.

**Each** — Keyed by identity (like Solid's `For`). The callback receives each
item as a **plain value** and an optional index: `fn(item)` or `fn(item, i)`.
Currently destroys and recreates all items on any list change. Future: the `by`
argument will extract a comparable key from each item, enabling DOM node reuse —
kept items have their nodes reordered, new items are mounted, removed items are
destroyed. Needs a new client-side `nacre-reorder` message to insert, remove,
and reorder individual child nodes by ID.

**Index** — Keyed by position (like Solid's `Index`). The callback receives each
item as a **reactive accessor** (`reactiveVal`) and an optional index:
`fn(item)` or `fn(item, i)` where `i` is a fixed integer. If the length is
stable, each slot's `reactiveVal` is updated in place so existing observers fire
with the new values without DOM recreation. Currently does a full rebuild when
list length changes. Future: incremental add/remove — grow by appending new
slots, shrink by destroying trailing slots.

## Client-Side Protocol

`nacre.js` registers three Shiny custom message handlers:

### `nacre-attr`

```js
{id: "nacre-3", attr: "textContent", value: "Count: 42"}
```

Sets a DOM property or attribute. Special-cased properties: `value`, `disabled`,
`checked`, `selected`, `textContent` are set as JS properties (not HTML
attributes). Skips the update if the target element has focus and the attribute
is `value` (optimistic update).

### `nacre-swap`

```js
{id: "nacre-5", html: "<li>new content</li>"}
```

Calls `Shiny.unbindAll` on the element, replaces `innerHTML`, then calls
`Shiny.bindAll` to initialize any Shiny outputs in the new content.

### `nacre-events`

```js
[
  {
    id: "nacre-2",
    event: "input",
    inputId: "nacre_ev_nacre-2_input",
    mode: "throttle",
    ms: 100,
    leading: true,
    coalesce: true,
  },
];
```

For each entry, attaches a DOM event listener on the element. The listener reads
the element's `value` and sends it as a Shiny input via
`Shiny.setInputValue(inputId, {value, id}, {priority: "event"})`.

If `mode` is set, wraps the listener in a throttle or debounce. When `coalesce`
is true, the rate limiter also gates on server idle state (via
`Shiny.shinyapp.$idleTimeout`), so events never queue faster than the server can
process them.

## Remaining Work

### `Each` — keyed reordering

Currently destroys and recreates all items on any list change. The callback
already receives plain values (not accessors), matching the target Solid `For`
semantics. Needs:

- `by` argument evaluation — extract comparable keys, diff old vs new.
- Per-item mount handles instead of one mount for the whole list.
- Diff old vs new keys to reorder, add, and remove individual items.
- New `nacre-reorder` client-side message to insert, remove, and reorder child
  nodes by ID (since `nacre-swap` replaces innerHTML wholesale).

### `Index` — incremental add/remove

Currently does a full rebuild when list length changes. Needs:

- Per-slot mount handles instead of one mount for the whole list.
- When list grows: append new slots, leave existing ones untouched.
- When list shrinks: destroy trailing slots.
- Same-length updates already work (reactiveVal in-place update).

### `Portal` (planned)

Not yet implemented. Would render content into a different DOM target. Needs
`process_tags` handling and client-side support.

### `Catch` (planned)

Not yet implemented. Would provide error boundaries: if any `observe()` inside
the content tree errors, tear it down and render a fallback.

### Controlled input: programmatic update while focused

The optimistic update logic in `nacre.js` skips setting `el.value` when the
element is focused (`document.activeElement === el`) to prevent cursor jumping
during typing. This also blocks programmatic clears — e.g. `new_text("")` after
adding a todo doesn't visually clear the input because it's still focused. Needs
a way to distinguish "server echoing back what the user typed" (skip) from
"server is setting a new value" (apply).

### Reactive child validation

Reactive children should return text only. Currently no validation — non-text
returns silently produce unexpected output.

### Each / For

Should I rename Each -> For to match Solid.js?

### Testing

No test suite yet. Key areas: `process_tags` extraction, observer lifecycle for
each control-flow primitive, rate-limiting metadata propagation,
`nacreOutput`/`renderNacre` integration, module scoping.
