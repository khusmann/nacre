## Two-Phase Rendering

nacre splits rendering into two phases: **process** and **mount**.

### Phase 1: `process_tags`

Walks the tag tree recursively and produces:

- **`tag`** — A clean HTML tag tree with all functions removed. Reactive
  attributes are replaced by stable auto-generated element IDs. Control-flow
  nodes become `<div style="display:contents">` placeholders.
- **`bindings`** — List of `{id, attr, fn}` for each reactive attribute.
- **`events`** — List of `{id, event, handler, mode, ms, leading, coalesce}` for
  each event callback.
- **`control_flows`** — List of `{type, id, ...}` for each `When`, `Each`,
  `Index`, or `Match` node.
- **`shiny_outputs`** — List of `{id, render_call}` for each `Output` node.

The tag tree is now plain HTML that can be sent to the client. All reactive
wiring is deferred to mount.

### Phase 2: `nacre_mount_processed`

Takes the output of `process_tags` and a Shiny `session`, then wires up:

1. **Reactive bindings** — Each binding gets an `observe()` that sends
   `nacre-attr` messages when the reactive value changes.
2. **Event handlers** — Each event gets an `observeEvent()` on a namespaced
   input ID (`nacre_ev_{id}_{event}`). The handler is dispatched based on its
   formal argument count (0, 1, or 2 args). Event registration is sent to the
   client as a `nacre-events` message.
3. **Shiny outputs** — Each output's render call is assigned to
   `session$output[[id]]`.
4. **Control-flow nodes** — Each node gets an `observe()` that manages its
   lifecycle (see below).

Returns a mount handle with `$tag` (the processed HTML) and `$destroy()` (tears
down all observers).

## Control Flow Lifecycle

Each control-flow type manages a `current_mount` — a mount handle from a
recursive `nacre_mount_processed` call.

**When** — Observes the condition. On change: destroys the current mount,
processes the active branch, sends a `nacre-swap` message, mounts the new
branch.

**Match** — Same pattern, but iterates cases to find the first truthy condition.

**Each** — Observes the items list. Diffs old vs new items by key (the `by`
argument extracts a comparable identity from each item). Kept items have their
DOM nodes reordered and their item accessor updated; new items are mounted;
removed items are destroyed. Each item holds its own mount handle so it can be
independently added, removed, or reordered. The callback contract is
`fn(item, index)` where `item` is a stable accessor and `index` is a reactive
value that updates when the item moves. Requires a `by` argument — R's
copy-on-modify semantics make reference identity too fragile to use as a
default. Needs a new client-side message (`nacre-reorder`) to insert, remove,
and reorder individual child nodes by ID, since `nacre-swap` replaces innerHTML
wholesale.

**Index** — Observes the items list. Each slot holds its own mount handle. If
the list grows, new slots are appended. If the list shrinks, trailing slots are
destroyed. If the length is stable, each slot's `reactiveVal` is updated in
place so existing observers fire with the new values without DOM recreation.
The callback contract is `fn(item, index)` where `item` is a `reactiveVal`
and `index` is a fixed integer.

## Client-Side Protocol

`nacre.js` registers three Shiny custom message handlers:

### `nacre-attr`

```js
{id: "nacre-3", attr: "textContent", value: "Count: 42"}
```

Sets a DOM property or attribute. Special-cased properties: `value`, `disabled`,
`checked`, `selected`, `textContent` are set as JS properties (not HTML
attributes). Skips the update if the target element has focus and the attribute
is `value` (optimistic update).

### `nacre-swap`

```js
{id: "nacre-5", html: "<li>new content</li>"}
```

Calls `Shiny.unbindAll` on the element, replaces `innerHTML`, then calls
`Shiny.bindAll` to initialize any Shiny outputs in the new content.

### `nacre-events`

```js
[
  {
    id: "nacre-2",
    event: "input",
    inputId: "nacre_ev_nacre-2_input",
    mode: "throttle",
    ms: 100,
    leading: true,
    coalesce: true,
  },
];
```

For each entry, attaches a DOM event listener on the element. The listener reads
the element's `value` and sends it as a Shiny input via
`Shiny.setInputValue(inputId, {value, id}, {priority: "event"})`.

If `mode` is set, wraps the listener in a throttle or debounce. When `coalesce`
is true, the rate limiter also gates on server idle state (via
`Shiny.shinyapp.$idleTimeout`), so events never queue faster than the server can
process them.

## Remaining Work

### `Each` — keyed reordering

Currently destroys and recreates all items on any list change. Needs:

- `by` argument (required) — a function that extracts a comparable key from
  each item.
- Per-item mount handles instead of one mount for the whole list.
- Diff old vs new keys to reorder, add, and remove individual items.
- New `nacre-reorder` client-side message to insert, remove, and reorder child
  nodes by ID (since `nacre-swap` replaces innerHTML wholesale).

### `Index` — incremental add/remove

Currently does a full rebuild when list length changes. Needs:

- Per-slot mount handles instead of one mount for the whole list.
- When list grows: append new slots, leave existing ones untouched.
- When list shrinks: destroy trailing slots.
- Same-length updates already work (reactiveVal in-place update).

### `Portal`

Exported as a stub. `process_tags` and `nacre_mount_processed` don't handle it.
Needs client-side support to render content into a different DOM target.

### `Catch`

Exported as a stub. Needs error-boundary logic: if any `observe()` inside the
content tree errors, tear it down and render the fallback.

### Reactive child validation

Reactive children should return text only. Currently no validation — non-text
returns silently produce unexpected output.

### Testing

No test suite yet. Key areas: `process_tags` extraction, observer lifecycle for
each control-flow primitive, rate-limiting metadata propagation,
`nacreOutput`/`renderNacre` integration, module scoping.
